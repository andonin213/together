      <h3>Product 1</h3>
      <p>This product is a shirt. Its uniuqe the fact it can tighten and elongate, and can change materials. The most common uses we<em>LifeStyle</em> believe is going from an office job to the gym, going from the gym to a casual get-together with friends, and shaving off precious minutes from getting dressed in th emorning by pick a color and <em>style</em> on the <strong> way to work</strong> </p>
      <p>With these core instances we wanted tokeep these prices on the low end. We want the working class people to be able to save money on their wardrobe with ous sacrificing style</p>

      <h3>Product 2</h3>
      <p>The Hair for any occassion? Yes, a wig that can stretch, shrink, chnge color, or be what ever you want on who ever you want. This idea came to us after using our prototype Shirt. We realized that there are more examples of wear adjustable clothin canbe used. We thought about hats but that seemed to be a loss, since it is a symbol of priide and wealth to own many hats. A wig was an interesting market since so few people ever wanted them. </p>
      <p>We kept the price very close to what the shirt came to cost becuase we wanted to but buy both together  </p>
