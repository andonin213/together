        My role as the programer i had to make the submit your writing page for <br>
        the first web site on the page i had to crate a way for people to submit<br>
        their writing and so that we can keep the idea of a infinity book. You <br>
        would have to include your email and your name and your reason for writing <br>
        this.For the second web site i had to create the product page and i worked <br>
        closely with the designer for the image.

         <h4>Role:</h4>
        My role was to make the logos for our client 1 and client 2. I thought of making <br>
        the logo simple and nice for the users to be attracted to. If I had made the logo <br>
        to something extravagant it would've looked too much and it would've made the site <br>
        look bad. In addition, I also did the products for the clients. So, I added and fix <br>
        some things around the product page. I also added the logo into the products of client 2.<br>

       <td>
         <h4>Role:</h4>

        all there credit card info if they wanted to donate money to support this <br>
        company.For the second client i had to create the about us page and i included <br>
        in that page the client team and what there role is and how they all started.<br>
