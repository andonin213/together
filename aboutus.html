         <h4>Role:</h4>
        My role was to make the logos for our client 1 and client 2. I thought of making <br>
        the logo simple and nice for the users to be attracted to. If I had made the logo <br>
        to something extravagant it would've looked too much and it would've made the site <br>
        look bad. In addition, I also did the products for the clients. So, I added and fix <br>
        some things around the product page. I also added the logo into the products of client 2.<br>
