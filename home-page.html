				<p class="w3-meduim"><strong>Pitch:</strong><br>  We believe a classic sleak look with a black and white color scheme would allow for a more professional appearance and let the focus be on the product.<br>
				<strong> Challenges:</strong><br> It was very difficult to combine our files at the end to create a finished page, we had to change links, so the page would work correctly<br>
				<strong>Description:</strong><br> Our website includes a pull out side menu, a home page dedicated to the team and their information, a product page, a page for people to submit their writing in order to continue the infinity book, and a donate page in order to boost funding for the project.
